This gamemode is inspired from a similar gamemode made in a 2D game called Barotrauma (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2657549869&searchtext=Combine+assault).

In this gamemode there are 2 teams, the Combine and the Resistance with a neutral team that consists of citizens.
The Combine must find and kill all the resistance members while the Resistance needs to stay low and recruit the citizens into their group until they have the numbers advantage and can overthrow the Universal Union.
Currently, the Combine can choose from 4 distinct classes.
There is a map in the works for this gamemode that will be put in this repository as soon as i finish it.
The mod is not finished, but it is in a playable state that is rather barebones.
